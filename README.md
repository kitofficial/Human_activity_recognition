# Human_activity_recognition

<b> Human activity recognition is an important yet challenging research area with many applications in healthcare, smart environments etc.
We aim to develop a model that is capable of recognizing multiple sets of daily activities under real-world conditions, using data collected by a single triaxial accelerometer built into a cell phone.
This data has been released by the Wireless Sensor Data Mining(WISDM) Lab. <http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/>
